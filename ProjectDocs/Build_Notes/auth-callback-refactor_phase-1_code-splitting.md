## Task Objective
Split the auth callback route.ts into smaller, more maintainable modules following our code quality principles.

## Current State Assessment
- Single large route.ts file containing all auth callback logic
- Mixed concerns: user creation, channel handling, and routing
- All types and utilities in same file

## Future State Goal
- Modular structure with separated concerns
- Clear file organization
- Improved maintainability and testability

## Implementation Plan

1. Create Directory Structure
   - [x] Create `app/auth/callback/lib` directory for supporting modules
   - [x] Create `app/auth/callback/types` directory for type definitions

2. Split Code into Modules
   - [x] Move types to `types/auth.ts`
   - [x] Create `lib/user-management.ts` for user-related functions
   - [x] Create `lib/channel-utils.ts` for channel operations
   - [x] Create `lib/route-utils.ts` for routing helpers
   - [x] Update main route.ts to use new modules

3. Update Imports and Exports
   - [x] Update import paths in route.ts
   - [x] Ensure proper type exports
   - [x] Verify all dependencies are correctly mapped

4. Testing and Validation
   - [x] Verify all functions work as expected
   - [x] Test auth flow end-to-end
   - [x] Ensure no regression in functionality

## Completion Notes
Successfully split the auth callback route into modular components:
- Created separate type definitions in `types/auth.ts`
- Isolated user management logic in `lib/user-management.ts`
- Separated channel operations in `lib/channel-utils.ts`
- Extracted routing utilities to `lib/route-utils.ts`
- Updated main route.ts to use the new modular structure

The code is now more maintainable, testable, and follows the single responsibility principle.
