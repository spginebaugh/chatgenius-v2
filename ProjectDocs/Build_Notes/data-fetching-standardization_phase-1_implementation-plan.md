# Data Fetching Standardization and Zustand Integration

## Task Objective
Implement a consistent data-fetching strategy across the application and integrate Zustand for client-side state management, optimizing for performance and developer experience.

## Current State Assessment
- Mixed data-fetching approaches (Server Components and client-side useEffect)
- No standardized state management solution
- Potential performance overhead from unnecessary client-side fetching

## Future State Goal
- Consistent, performant data-fetching strategy prioritizing Server Components
- Well-structured Zustand stores for client-side state
- Clear patterns for when to use each approach

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Setup and Dependencies ✅
- [x] Install Zustand
- [x] Create store configuration in `lib/stores/config.ts`
  - [x] Implement devtools and persist middleware
  - [x] Add type-safe store creation helper
  - [x] Configure storage options
- [x] Setup store provider pattern for hydration
- [x] Add devtools middleware for development

Implementation Details:
- Created `lib/stores/config.ts` with type-safe store creation and middleware configuration
- Created `lib/stores/ui.ts` as a test store with theme and sidebar state
- Configured persistence and TypeScript helpers for store state and actions

### Step 2: Audit Current Data Fetching ✅
- [x] Identify all data fetching locations in codebase
- [x] Categorize fetches into client-side, server-side, and hybrid
- [x] Document findings in data-fetching audit document

Key Findings:
- Real-time features must remain client-side
- Initial data loading can be server-side
- Chat implementation is a good candidate for hybrid approach

### Step 3: Implement Zustand Stores ✅
- [x] Create domain-specific stores for messages, users, and channels
- [x] Implement core store features:
  - [x] Type-safe store creation
  - [x] Persistence configuration
  - [x] DevTools integration
  - [x] Hydration handling

Implementation Details:
- Created three main stores:
  1. `messages.ts`: Handles message state, thread messages, and reactions
  2. `users.ts`: Manages user presence, profiles, and online status
  3. `channels.ts`: Handles channel state and unread counts
- Each store includes:
  - TypeScript interfaces for state and actions
  - Loading and error states
  - Reset functionality
  - Persistence configuration

### Step 4: Server Components Migration ✅
- [x] Create data fetching utilities in `lib/queries.ts`
  - [x] `getChannels()`: Fetch channel data
  - [x] `getUsers()`: Fetch user data
  - [x] `getCurrentUser()`: Fetch current user
  - [x] `getChannelMessages(channelId: string)`: Fetch channel messages
  - [x] `getDirectMessages(userId: string, otherUserId: string)`: Fetch DMs
  - [x] `getThreadMessages(parentId: string, parentType: string)`: Fetch thread messages
  - [x] `getReactions(messageId: string, messageType: string)`: Fetch reactions
- [x] Implement error handling and type safety
- [x] Ensure proper data relationships in queries

Implementation Details:
- Created server-side data fetching utilities in `lib/queries.ts`
- Implemented type-safe queries using database types
- Added proper error handling and return types
- Configured relationships and joins for efficient data loading

### Step 5: Client-Side Integration ✅
- [x] Create hooks to integrate Zustand stores with data fetching
  - [x] `useMessages`: Message state, threads, and reactions
  - [x] `useUsers`: User presence and profiles
  - [x] `useChannels`: Channel management and unread counts
- [x] Implement optimistic updates
  - [x] Message sending with temporary IDs
  - [x] Channel creation with temporary IDs
  - [x] User status updates
- [x] Add error handling and loading states
  - [x] Consistent error handling across hooks
  - [x] Loading states for async operations
  - [x] Type-safe error messages
- [x] Setup real-time subscriptions
  - [x] Message updates (channel, DM, thread)
  - [x] User presence and status
  - [x] Channel updates

Implementation Details:
- Created three main hooks that integrate stores with data fetching
- Implemented optimistic updates for better UX
- Added comprehensive error handling and loading states
- Setup real-time subscriptions for live updates

### Step 6: Server Actions Implementation ✅
- [x] Create server actions for messages
  - [x] Channel messages
  - [x] Direct messages  
  - [x] Thread messages
- [x] Create server actions for users
  - [x] Profile updates
  - [x] Status updates
- [x] Create server actions for channels
  - [x] Create channel
  - [x] Update channel
  - [x] Delete channel
- [x] Add error handling and authentication checks
- [x] Implement cache revalidation

Implementation Details:
- Created server actions in `app/actions/` directory
- Each action includes authentication checks and error handling
- Added cache revalidation using `revalidatePath`
- Organized actions by domain (messages, users, channels)
- All actions are properly typed with TypeScript

### Step 7: Testing and Validation
